He mentioned that, in his view, machine learning is one of the most exciting areas in computer science. That made me pause and ask: what does that imply for me? If I aim to engage with topics that resonate with people like Sebastian Raschka, then machine learning is not optional—it demands serious consideration. The same applies to anyone who aligns with his perspective or operates within his intellectual orbit.

### Chegg Recommended Question:

**Write a C program to implement a simple “one-shot” machine learning algorithm that predicts house prices based on historical data.**
You will use a linear regression model of the form:
$$

y = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + w_4x_4

$$
Where:
* $y$ is the predicted price of the house.

* $x_1$ = number of bedrooms

* $x_2$ = total size of the house

* $x_3$ = number of baths

* $x_4$ = year the house was built

* $w_0, w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4$ are weights to be learned from training data.

**Your program must:**

1. Take as input a dataset of house attributes and their corresponding prices (training data).

2. Learn the weights $w_0$ through $w_4$ using this training data (likely through a closed-form solution like normal equation).

3. Predict the price of a new house using the learned weights and its attributes.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

   1. RAW DATA
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   Before I can even begin, I must remind myself what
   "data" means in this context.

   - "Data" is a collection of observed facts or values.
   - Each row here is about one "house".
   - Each house is described by 5 numbers.

   Let me carefully name them:

     1st number → bedrooms (x1)
     2nd number → size in square feet (x2)
     3rd number → baths (x3)
     4th number → year built (x4)
     5th number → actual selling price (y)

   This table is my ground truth: what really happened.

   I store it as a 2D array of type 'double'.
   A "double" is a floating-point number,
   meaning it can represent decimals, not just integers.
   ========================================================== */
double data[][5] = {
    {3, 2000, 2, 1990, 250000},
    {4, 2500, 3, 2005, 320000},
    {2, 1500, 1, 1980, 180000},
    {5, 3000, 3, 2015, 400000}
};
int rows = 4;

/* ==========================================================
   2. RULE LETTERS
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   I want to "learn" a rule.

   The rule is a formula of this exact form:

      price = a + b*bedrooms + c*size + d*baths + e*year

   Let me unpack this step by step:

   - The word "price" here means: my GUESS of what
    the house price should be, not the true one.

   - The letters (a, b, c, d, e) are unknown numbers.
     They are the "knobs" I can tune.
     At the start, I know nothing, so I set them all to 0.

   Why these letters?
   - 'a' is the base offset (sometimes called intercept).
   - 'b' is the weight tied to bedrooms.
   - 'c' is the weight tied to size.
   - 'd' is the weight tied to baths.
   - 'e' is the weight tied to year.

   Multiplying each letter by the corresponding house
   feature means: "How much does that feature push
   the final price guess?"
   ========================================================== */
double a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0, e = 0;

/* ==========================================================
   3. LEARNING FUNCTION
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   Now I want to *adjust* a,b,c,d,e so that my rule
   matches the data.

   This process is called "learning" or "training".
   But what does it really mean?

   To learn is:
     - Look at how wrong my guesses are,
     - Assign "blame" to each letter,
     - Adjust the letters to reduce future wrongness.

   This is the heart of machine learning.
   ========================================================== */
void learn(int times, double step) {
    for (int t = 0; t < times; t++) {

        // sa, sb, sc, sd, se are total blame accumulators
        double sa = 0, sb = 0, sc = 0, sd = 0, se = 0;

        // Look at each house one by one
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            double x1 = data[i][0];  // bedrooms
            double x2 = data[i][1];  // size
            double x3 = data[i][2];  // baths
            double x4 = data[i][3];  // year
            double y  = data[i][4];  // true price

            // Step 1: compute guess
            double g = a + b*x1 + c*x2 + d*x3 + e*x4;

            // Step 2: difference between guess and truth
            double diff = g - y;

            /* ------------------------------------------------
               Step 3: WHY ADD INTO SUMS?
               ------------------------------------------------
               Now I must face the deepest "why".

               g = a + b*x1 + c*x2 + d*x3 + e*x4

               Every part of g came from a letter.
               If g overshoots y (too big), it means those
               letters collectively pushed too high.
               If g undershoots y (too small),
               those letters collectively pushed too low.

               But not every letter is equally responsible.

               - a always contributes once,
                 so blame for a is just diff.

               - b's contribution is multiplied by x1,
                 so if x1 = many bedrooms,
                 then b had more influence on g.
                 Thus blame for b is diff*x1.

               - Similarly for c (size), d (baths), e (year).

               I add these blames into sa,sb,sc,sd,se.
               The idea: across all houses, keep track
               of how much each letter tends to push wrong.
            ------------------------------------------------ */
            sa += diff;
            sb += diff * x1;
            sc += diff * x2;
            sd += diff * x3;
            se += diff * x4;
        }

        /* ----------------------------------------------------
           Step 4: UPDATE LETTERS
           ----------------------------------------------------
           Now I subtract a fraction of the blame
           from each letter.

           Why subtract?
           - If diff was positive (guess too high),
             then subtracting reduces the letter values,
             lowering future guesses.
           - If diff was negative (guess too low),
             then subtracting a negative means ADDING,
             raising the letters.

           The parameter 'step' is crucial:
           - It is a tiny number that says
             how big of a correction I allow at once.
           - Too big → I overshoot and never stabilize.
           - Too small → it takes forever to learn.
        ---------------------------------------------------- */
        a -= step * sa;
        b -= step * sb;
        c -= step * sc;
        d -= step * sd;
        e -= step * se;
    }
}
